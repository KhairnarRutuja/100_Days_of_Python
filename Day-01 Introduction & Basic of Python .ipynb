    "### What is pyhton?\n",
    "* Python is a popular Programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.Dynamically Typed:-** \n",
    "- Python is dynamically typed, meaning you don't need to declare the type of a variable when you create one. The type is inferred at runtime. \n",
    "\n",
    "**2. General Purpose:-**\n",
    "- Python is a general-purpose programming language, which means it can be used for a wide range of applications. Whether you're developing web applications, data analysis tools, artificial intelligence algorithms, scientific computing software, or anything else, Python can handle it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):-**\n",
    "- Python supports object-oriented programming paradigms. You can define classes and create objects with properties and methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Interpreted and High-Level:-**\n",
    "- Python is an interpreted language, which means the code is executed line by line without the need for a separate compilation step. This makes the development process quicker and more interactive. Python is also high-level, which means it abstracts away many low-level details like memory management, making it easier to write and understand code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Created by Guido van Rossum:-**\n",
    "- Python was created by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s.\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. CWI (Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica):-**\n",
    "- Python's development started at CWI (Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica) in the Netherlands, where Guido van Rossum worked at the time."

    "### Features of Python\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Simplicity and Ease of Understanding:-**\n",
    "- Python is designed to prioritize simplicity and readability.\n",
    "- Python is simple and easy to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Interpreted and Platform-Independent:-**\n",
    "- Python is an interpreted language, which means that each line of code is executed one at a time, making debugging easier compared to compiled languages. Moreover, Python's interpreter is available on various platforms (such as Windows, macOS, Linux, etc.), allowing Python code to run seamlessly across different operating systems without modifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Open-Source:-**\n",
    "- Python is an open-source programming language, meaning its source code is freely available to the public.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Rich Library Support:-**\n",
    "- Python boasts an extensive standard library as well as a vast ecosystem of third-party libraries and frameworks. These libraries cover a wide range of functionalities, from scientific computing (e.g., NumPy, SciPy) and machine learning (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) to web development (e.g., Django, Flask) and automation (e.g., Selenium, OpenCV). \n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Integration Capabilities:-** \n",
    "- Python's versatility extends to its ability to seamlessly integrate with other programming languages. \n",
    "-  Python can interact with libraries and components written in languages like C, C++, Java, and more. "
